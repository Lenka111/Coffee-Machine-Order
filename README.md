# Coffee-Machine-Order
The completed program performs all of the required tasks (and more), plus I completed the extra credit by adding an exception handling when the user enters numbers and characters into text field t1 (customer name) and allow for reinput. Added some gifs in my app. Also changed the text font and color when order summary is displayed to the user. I let the constructor do its work by supplementing it with all the needed changes and additions. I used multiline text in JLabel l7(order summary) by putting HTML in the code(<html><BR></html>), and one gif in l8 instead of using JOptionPane.I did use, however, JOptionPane for the exception handling and“About” section of the app and used another gif there. I also created another button b3 in l7 that closes the app when clicked. Added two JMenu() objects: File and Help. The File menu allows you to exit the running app and the Help menu show information about the programmer(myself) and the program. Formatted the price to show the dollar sign, etc.
